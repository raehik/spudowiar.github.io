    From nothing to blog in under a day
---

Woot. Like I said, [this is a blog]({% post_url jekyll/2015-08-24-hello-world %}).
And this is the second post. But the third. And the second. But it's the third. 
And this is a joke. And it's really unfunny now... :laughing:

Anyway... before I even wrote the first (which turned out to be the second) 
post, there was much work to be done.

It took a day's work to finally get up and running but I was proud of my self. 
I chose Jekyll because I like DIY. I would have chosen Blogger or Wordpress if I 
didn't. But I do.

If I didn't write plugins for it or write my own theme for it, it wouldn't be 
DIY? And, anyway, I had a vision of what my blog would look like before I made. 
And my idea was just like [this](#). And yes, that was a link to the current 
page because, well, I believe I have achieved what I wanted.

Maybe it isn't as advanced as [Jekyll New](!GitHub "jglovier/jekyll-new") or as 
robust as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) but it's [configurable](!source
_config.yml), nice-looking, and it works on smaller displays using [`@media` 
rules](!source _sass/navigation.scss) --- the right way to do things. Also, it 
works on IE 5.5. :no_mouth:

If something works on IE6, that's something to celebrate. But if something 
**just works** on IE6, that's a miracle. And no, `works != just_works`. Also, 
no, I don't like Microsoft. Apart from Outlook.com. And Office because I'm in 
school and have been ~~coerced~~ forced into the Microsoft ecosystem. :blush:

I use a [tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/) so my workflow is really 
simple. I have a browser with the blog open on workspace 1. On workspace 2, I 
have my terminal with Vim, the **best** editor, and --- sometimes --- a browser 
open to look up stuff. Finally, I have `jekyll serve` running on the last 
workspace (workspace 10), auto-generating my blog. Awesome.

I also write myself [plugins](!source _plugins) for Liquid and Redcarpet, 
the **best** Markdown rendering library. This makes blogging so much easier.

That's the thing about Jekyll. It's so customisable. And `customisable == 
awesome`.

_**NOTE:** I had absolutely no Ruby experience before starting this blog :wink:_

_**NOTE:** After finishing this post, I immediately proceeded to rewrite all the 
SCSS as it was not clean enough for me :expressionless:_
