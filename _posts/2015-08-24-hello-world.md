# This is a blog

Yep. It's a blog. It's my blog. Why? Because it's useful.

It's useful to me and hopefully, it'll be useful to others. It'll be a place for me to
document things for me to look back on and for unsuspecting interneters to find.

It'll be an adventure of moaning and coding and you'll be my sounding board as I try different
stuff out. And guess what? It's
[open source](https://github.com/spudowiar/spudowiar.github.io)!

**TL;DR:** It's a blog about programming and stuff. Also, this is the first post. But it is
the second post.
