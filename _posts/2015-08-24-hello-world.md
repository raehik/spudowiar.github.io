# This is a blog

Yep. It's a blog. It's my blog. Why? Because it's useful.

It's useful to me and hopefully, it'll be useful to others. It'll be a place for 
me to document things for me to look back on and for unsuspecting interneters to 
find.

It'll be an adventure of moaning and coding and you'll be my sounding board as I 
try different stuff out. And guess what? It's [open source](!repo)!

**TL;DR:** It's a blog about programming and stuff. Also, this is the first 
post. But it is the second post.

:smile:
