Woot. Like I said, [this is a blog]({% post_url 2015-08-24-hello-world %}). And 
this is the second post. But the third. And the second. But it's the third. And 
this joke is really unfunny now... :laughing:

Anyway... before I even wrote the first (which turned out to be the second) 
post, there was much work to be done.

It took a day's work to finally get up and running but I was proud of my self. 
I chose Jekyll because I like DIY.
